---

Let's kick things off by building this blog itself. Here is how it was done.

## The plan

Build this blog, but do it in the clouds.

## Github
First, we create a new GitHub project. You can do this right in the Github web UI. We'll go from nothing to a live blog and never touch our local disk.

Mine is (https://github.com/omnifroodle/froodles)

## Gitpod
Once you have your Github repo, we'll need a place to work on it. Go join Gitpod. Then open the blog there.

You can open a dev environment in Gitpod by just taking `gitpod.io\#` onto the front of your github url. You can steal mine here: (gitpod.io\#https://github.com/omnifroodle/froodles)

First, lets keep our git repo from bloating up with a decent gitignore, this one comes from the default  Gatsby starter here: [gatsby-starter-default/.gitignore at master · gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default · GitHub](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/blob/master/.gitignore)

```
# Logs
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Runtime data
pids
*.pid
*.seed
*.pid.lock

# Directory for instrumented libs generated by jscoverage/JSCover
lib-cov

# Coverage directory used by tools like istanbul
coverage

# nyc test coverage
.nyc_output

# Grunt intermediate storage (http://gruntjs.com/creating-plugins#storing-task-files)
.grunt

# Bower dependency directory (https://bower.io/)
bower_components

# node-waf configuration
.lock-wscript

# Compiled binary addons (http://nodejs.org/api/addons.html)
build/Release

# Dependency directories
node_modules/
jspm_packages/

# Typescript v1 declaration files
typings/

# Optional npm cache directory
.npm

# Optional eslint cache
.eslintcache

# Optional REPL history
.node_repl_history

# Output of 'npm pack'
*.tgz

# dotenv environment variable files
.env*

# gatsby files
.cache/
public

# Mac files
.DS_Store

# Yarn
yarn-error.log
.pnp/
.pnp.js
# Yarn Integrity file
.yarn-integrity
```

Next we'll need a `gitpod.yml` on the root of our project.  This one should be good for starters:

```
ports:
  - port: 8000
tasks:
  - init: yarn install
    command: yarn develop
```

## Gatsby

Time to bring in the bits. This is a pretty standard Gatsby install with one flourish. I'll explain in a minute. 
```bash
gatsby new froodles https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```

Here is our catch though, we are already in our "project" directory.  Since `gatsby new` wants to build in a subdirectory, we let it.  Now lets grab the result and move it back up one level to our project directory.

```bash
gitpod /workspace/froodles $ cp -rf froodles/* .
gitpod /workspace/froodles $ rm -rf froodles/
```

## Netlify
Now, sprinkle in some Netlify (for hosting, and later for easy Lambda goodness):

```
npm install --save netlify-cms-app gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms
```


Create a config.yml file in the directory structure you see below:
```
├── static
│   ├── admin
│   │   ├── config.yml
```

```
backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: master

media_folder: static/img
public_folder: /img

collections:
  - name: ‘blog’
    label: ‘Blog’
    folder: ‘content/blog’
    create: true
    slug: ‘index’
    media_folder: ‘’
    public_folder: ‘’
    path: ‘{{title}}/index’
    editor:
      preview: false
    fields:
      - { label: ‘Title’, name: ‘title’, widget: ‘string’ }
      - { label: ‘Publish Date’, name: ‘date’, widget: ‘datetime’ }
      - { label: ‘Description’, name: ‘description’, widget: ‘string’ }
      - { label: ‘Body’, name: ‘body’, widget: ‘markdown’ }
```


Add the netify plugin to the `gatsby-config.js` (all these files are available in my shared repo):

```
plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-netlify-cms`]
```

Check it all back into Github and you are ready to pass it to Netlify for hosting.  Follow the steps here: (https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/)


## Gitpod, one more thing...

To run your blog on gitpod.io while you develop, just hit the terminal and run:
`yarn develop`
